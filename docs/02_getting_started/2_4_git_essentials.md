# Git Essentials  

To use Git effectively, it's important to understand a few fundamentals. 

Using Git in Terminal is what industry professionals do, along with our students. The recommendation is to also use Git in Terminal (instead of a GUI). If you are new to this, it's best to learn how to navigate in Terminal first, and then move on to learning more about Git. 

The resources below will help you get started.
