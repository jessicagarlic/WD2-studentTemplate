## Install Git  

Check to see if you have git installed. In Terminal, type...

``` 
git --version 

```

If you don't have git installed, visit the [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/) site and download the most recent git release. It is ok if you have an older version of git running, but you can always install a newer version and will most likely want to update the application every now-and-then. 

**Note:** You do not need to install XCode. When checking to see if you have git, Terminal may prompt you to install XCode. Instead of installing XCode, visit the official git-scm site link listed above, download, and then run the latest installer.

## Customize Settings

To effectively use Git, configure the following basic settings in Terminal...


| Setting | Terminal Command |
|:------------- |:-------------|
| User Name | git config --global user.name "John Doe" |
| eMail | git config --global user.email johnDoe@fullsail.com |
| Text Editor | git config --global core.editor nano |

User and eMail information is essential. It identifies who made changes to a repository. 

**Custom Text Editor**  
The example above sets the default text editor to Nano. Without setting your preferred text editor, Git may attempt to use the less friendly "Vim". You are welcome to customize the text editor setting to your preference. If you're just getting started with Git, [Nano](https://medium.com/linode-cube/emacs-nano-or-vim-choose-your-terminal-based-text-editor-wisely-8f3826c92a68) is recommended. 

* You can check your settings at any time with this command: `git config --list`  
* To check an individual setting type: `git config <setting>`. 

> For example: `git config user.name`

Outside of customizing your name, eMail, and preferred text editor, there are many other settings you can customize into the future.
